## Overview

- Why did you hire me???
- Why do we _all_ work here?
- Imagine a Bayesian Utopia
- New tools

## Why did you hire me???

- Please tell me.
- I've done a lot of Bayesian meta analysis of RCTs, and I'm good at R.

## Why do we all work here?

Content for the second slide

## Imagine a Bayesian Utopia

- Comprehensive Knowledge Integration: Systematic pre-registration, transparent search protocols, and inclusion of unpublished data to minimize publication bias, with rigorous documentation of all methodological decisions from paper selection through data extraction.
- Sophisticated Measurement Harmonization: Latent variable modeling to reconcile diverse outcome measures across studies, with explicit modeling of measurement error, reliability coefficients, and detection bias to produce more accurate effect estimates.
- Robust Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling: Fully Bayesian estimation with informative priors, multi-level structures capturing dependencies between studies, and explicit modeling of contextual variables and implementation features that drive heterogeneity.
- Reproducibility Infrastructure: Open data repositories, containerized computational environments, complete code sharing with documentation, and interactive dashboards allowing non-technical folks to explore analytical decisions and sensitivity to alternative specifications.
- Decision-Oriented Communication: Translation of statistical findings into practical significance through posterior predictive distributions, decision-theoretic frameworks for policy recommendations, and direct involvement of stakeholders in interpretation and implementation planning.

## It all starts with data quality, and data quality starts with workflow

- Does our code actually do what we say it does? How do we know?
- Can other people find/run/understand/edit/improve it?
- Are our processes confusing and painful such that we call burn out?

## New Tools

- These tools are widely used, so we do our RAs and undergrads a service by having them adopt them -- they will serve them well in any data analysis context, and also are nice resume lines.

## Peoples' thoughts from yesterday:

- Opportunities for RAs to learn.
- Notion seems like a good tool for documenting questions.
- Romil: we need more input from PIs during harmonization. Historically I've found GitHub actually helps with this, having PIs all weigh in and engage with each other in a single shared space that is documented forever. They tend to find it an engaging forum.
